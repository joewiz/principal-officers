            <p>Congress, in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1971 (P.L. 92-226; 86 Stat. 28),
                authorized the President to appoint, with the advice and consent of the Senate, an
                officer for the purpose of coordinating the government’s security assistance
                programs. Under this act, signed into law on Feb 7, 1972, the President has
                commissioned all incumbents as “Under Secretaries of State for Coordinating Security
                Assistance Programs.” Since then, the Department of State has assigned the position
                different functional designations. In addition to coordinating U.S. security assistance
                programs, duties associated with this position have also included at one time or another:
                nuclear non-proliferation; control of technology transfers and strategic goods; and
                coordination of international communications policy.</p>
