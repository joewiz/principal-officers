            <p>The Secretary of State created the position of Counselor for the Department of State
                in 1909 as part of a general Department reorganization. This list does not include a
                Counselor for the Department of State appointed by the Secretary of State in 1909.
                In 1912, the position became a Presidential appointment (37 Stat. 372). Between 1913
                and 1919, the Counselor served as the Departmentâ€™s second-ranking officer, assuming
                the role previously exercised by the Assistant Secretary of State. In 1919, the
                newly-created position of Under Secretary of State subsumed the duties of the Counselor.</p>
