            <p>Congress provided for the position of Under Secretary of State in a general
                government appropriations act adopted on Mar 1, 1919 (40 Stat. 1224). The Under
                Secretary subsumed the duties of the Department’s Counselor, who had served as the
                second ranking officer in the Department since 1913.</p>
            <p>The Under Secretary functioned as the principal deputy and chief assistant to the
                Secretary of State, served as Acting Secretary of State in the Secretary’s absence,
                and provided guidance and direction to the activities of the Department. Prior to
                1944, a number of offices in the Department reported directly to the Under
                Secretary. In Jul 1972, the position of Deputy Secretary superseded that of Under
                Secretary of State.</p>
