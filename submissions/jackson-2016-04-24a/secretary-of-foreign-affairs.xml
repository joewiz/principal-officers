            <p>Following the organization of the government under the Constitution, Mar 4, 1789,
               John Jay continued in charge of foreign relations, informally supervising the Department
               of Foreign Affairs upon its creation, Jul 27, 1789, and the Department of State from
               the adoption of that name for the Department (effective Sep 15, 1789) until
               Thomas Jefferson took office as Secretary of State Mar 22, 1790. Jay had meanwhile (Sep 26,
               1789) been appointed Chief Justice.</p>
