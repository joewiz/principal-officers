            <p>The Continental Congress voted on Jan 10, 1781, to establish a Department of Foreign
                Affairs; on <hi>Aug 10</hi> of that year, it elected Robert R. Livingston as
                Secretary of Foreign Affairs. The Secretary’s duties involved corresponding with
                U.S. representatives abroad and with ministers of foreign powers.</p>
            <p>The Secretary was also charged with transmitting Congress’ instructions to U.S.
                agents abroad and was authorized to attend sessions of Congress. A further Act of
                Feb 22, 1782, allowed the Secretary to ask and respond to questions during sessions
                of the Continental Congress.</p>
