            <p>The Department of State established the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                European, Far Eastern, Near Eastern and African Affairs during the general
                Department of State reorganization of Dec 20, 1944, after Congress had authorized an
                increase in the number of Assistant Secretaries of State from four to six (Dec 8,
                1944; P.L. 78-242; 58 Stat. 798). The reorganization was the first to provide
                substantive designations for specific Assistant Secretary positions. The incumbent
                oversaw three of the Departmentâ€™s four geographic offices; a separate Assistant
                Secretary was responsible for American Republic Affairs. In Jun 1947, the Department
                created an Assistant Secretary for Political Affairs to oversee the four geographic
                offices and to assume the duties previously exercised by the two geographic
                Assistant Secretaries, whose positions were then discontinued.</p>
