            <p>On Aug 16, 1985, Congress changed the title to include Agricultural Affairs (P.L.
                99-93; 99 Stat. 405). The Under Secretary for Economic and Agricultural Affairs
                served as the principal adviser to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary (previously
                Under Secretary) on matters relating to foreign economic and commercial policy.
                Specified duties, responsibilities, and assignments have varied over time. Each
                incumbent is commissioned with a functional designation as part of his title.</p>
