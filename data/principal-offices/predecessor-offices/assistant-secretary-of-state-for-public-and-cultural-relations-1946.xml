            <p>The Department of State created the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                Public and Cultural Relations during a general reorganization in Dec 1944, after
                Congress authorized an increase in the number of Assistant Secretaries in the
                Department from four to six (Dec 8, 1944; P.L. 78-472; 58 Stat. 798). The
                reorganization was the first to designate substantive designations for specific
                Assistant Secretary positions. Initially, incumbents supervised the
                forerunners of the U.S. Information Agency and the Voice of America.</p>
