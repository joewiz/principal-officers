            <p>In April 1980, the Department of State, by administrative action, established the
                Bureau of Refugee Programs. The Director holds a rank equivalent to an Assistant
                Secretary of State and Serves concurrently as Deputy Coordinator for Refugee
                Affairs. All Directors of the Bureau of Refugee Programs have been designated, not
                commissioned. Since Mar 1979, the Department of State has designated certain
                Ambassadors at Large as Coordinators for Refugee Affairs. The Bureau of Refugee
                Affairs subsumed duties relating to refugee matters previously exercised by
                components in the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, the Bureau of
                International Organization Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.
                Previously, distinct units in the Department of State concerned with refugee affairs
                existed in the Bureau of United Nations Affairs and the Bureau of Security and
                Consular Affairs. Also, between Sep 1966 and Jun 1975, a Special Assistant for
                Refugee and Migration Affairs, with rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary served
                in the office of the Secretary of State.</p>
