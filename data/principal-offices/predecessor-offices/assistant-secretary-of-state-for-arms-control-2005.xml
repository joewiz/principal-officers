            <p>The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of October 21, 1998 (112 State
                2681-767) authorized the incorporation of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
                into the Department of State. It also authorized the appointment of up to 6 Under
                Secretaries and 24 Assistant Secretaries (112 Stat 2681-825). The Reorganization
                Plan of December 30, 1998, called for the incorporation to take place April 1, 1999.
                Two, and later three Bureaus were formed in the Department to deal with arms control
                matters. The Bureau of Arms Control was established April 1, 1999, when ACDA was
                incorporated into the Department of State.</p>
