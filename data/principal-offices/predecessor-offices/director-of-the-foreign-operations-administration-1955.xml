        <div>
            <p>Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1953 (67 Stat. 639) established the Foreign Operations
                Administration to oversee foreign assistance programs previously administered by the
                Mutual Security Agency and the Technical Cooperation Administration. The Director
                was appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Executive
                Order 10610 of May 9, 1955, abolished the Foreign Operations Administration, after
                which its economic assistance passed to the International Cooperation Administration
                and its military assistance function to the Department of Defense.</p>
