        <div>
            <p>On Apr 21, 1975, in response to growing Congressional interest in human rights issues
                in foreign policy, the Department of State established the position of Coordinator
                for Humanitarian Affairs. The International Security Assistance and Arms Export
                Control Act of 1976 (Jun 30, 1976; P.L. 94-329; 90 Stat. 748) made the Coordinator a
                Presidential appointee, subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, and changed
                the title to Coordinator for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. The Foreign
                Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1978 (Aug 17, 1977; P.L. 95-105; 91
                Stat. 847) changed the Coordinatorâ€™s title to Assistant Secretary of State for Human
                Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. The Department of State, by administrative action,
                established the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs on Oct 27, 1977.</p>
