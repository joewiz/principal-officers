            <p>The Department of State established the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                Far Eastern Affairs in 1949, after the Commission on Organization of the Executive
                Branch of Government (Hoover Commission) recommended that certain offices be
                upgraded to bureau level and after Congress increased the number of Assistant
                Secretaries of State from six to ten (May 26, 1949; P.L. 81-73; 63 Stat. 111).</p>
