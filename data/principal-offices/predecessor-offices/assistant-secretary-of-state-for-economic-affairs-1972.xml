            <p>The Department of State created the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                Economic Affairs during a general Department reorganization in Dec 1944, after
                Congress authorized an increase in the number of Assistant Secretaries in the
                Department from four to six (Dec 8, 1944; P.L. 78-472; 58 Stat. 798). The
                reorganization was the first to designate substantive designations for specific
                Assistant Secretary positions.</p>
