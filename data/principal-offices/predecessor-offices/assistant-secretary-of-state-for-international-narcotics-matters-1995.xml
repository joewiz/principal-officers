            <p>On Oct 1, 1978, Congress, in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal Year
                1979 (P.L. 95-426; 92 Stat. 969), authorized the position of Assistant Secretary of
                State for International Narcotics Matters, to be responsible for the overall
                coordination of the role of the Department of State in the international aspects of
                narcotics problems. This title had been given in full in each appointee’s
                commission. The new Assistant Secretary, who headed the Bureau for International
                Narcotics Matters, replaced a Senior Adviser to the Secretary of State on Narcotics,
                who had served with a rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary of State since 1971.
                The Department of State first supported the Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of
                Narcotics in 1909.</p>
