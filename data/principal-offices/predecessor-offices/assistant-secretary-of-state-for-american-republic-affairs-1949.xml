            <p>The Department re-established the position in Jul 1949 after the Commission
                on Organization of the Executive Branch of Government (Hoover Commission)
                recommended that certain offices be upgraded to bureau level and after Congress
                increased the number of Assistant Secretaries of State from six to ten (May 26,
                1949; P.L. 81-73; 63 Stat. 111). Department Announcement 96 of July 6, 1949
                assigned Assistant Secretaries to the Offices of European Affairs, Near East
                and African Affairs, American Republic Affairs, and United Nations Affairs.</p>
