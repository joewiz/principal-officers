            <p>On Aug 1, 1976, the Department of State elevated the position of Special Assistant to
                the Secretary of State and Coordinator of the Office for Combating Terrorism to that
                of Director of the Office for Combating Terrorism, with rank equivalent to an
                Assistant Secretary of State. All Directors have been designated by the Secretary of
                State, not commissioned. The Department had established the earlier position in
                October 1972 to head an interagency working-level committee charged with addressing
                the problem of international terrorism. The Department has changed the incumbent’s
                title three times since 1976: to “Ambassador at Large for Counter-Terrorism” on Nov.
                4, 1985, to “Coordinator for Counter-Terrorism” on May 1, 1989, and “Director of the
                Bureau of Counterterrorism” on Jan. 4, 2012.</p>
