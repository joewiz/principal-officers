            <p>The Department of State established a Bureau of International Cultural Relations on
                Jun 1, 1959, and subsequently renamed it the Bureau of Education and Cultural
                Affairs on Apr 17, 1960. The following year, the Department elevated the position of
                Special Assistant for Coordination of International Educational and Cultural
                Relations, which headed the Bureau, to the rank of Assistant Secretary of State. The
                Department had first established a Division of Cultural Relations in 1938. Cultural
                relations was also part of the responsibilities of the first Assistant Secretary of
                State for Public Affairs created in 1944. In 1978 the Bureau was abolished and its
                functions transferred to the International Communications Agency (subsequently the
                U.S. Information Agency) under Reorganization Plan No. 2 (91 Stat. 1637).</p>
