            <p>The Department of State created the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                Congressional Relations and International Conferences during a general
                reorganization in Dec 1944, after Congress authorized an increase in the number of
                Assistant Secretaries in the Department from four to six (Dec 8, 1944; P.L. 78-472;
                58 Stat 789). The reorganization was the first to assign substantive designations to
                specific Assistant Secretary positions. The title of the Assistant Secretary
                responsible for Congressional relations has varied over the years.</p>
