            <p>The Department of State established the position of Assistant Secretary of State for
                Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs on Oct 3, 1949, after the Commission
                on Organization of the Executive Branch of Government (Hoover Commission)
                recommended that certain offices be upgraded to bureau level and after Congress
                increased the number of Assistant Secretaries of State from six to ten (May 26,
                1949; P.L. 81-73; 63 Stat. 111). The Department of State had previously established
                a Division of Near Eastern Affairs in 1909, which dealt with Central, Southern, and
                Eastern Europe as well as with the Middle East. The final remnant of this practice
                ended on Apr 18, 1974, when the Department transferred responsibility for Greece,
                Turkey, and Cyprus to the Bureau of European Affairs. The Division of Near Eastern
                Affairs included Egypt and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) from its inception, and acquired
                responsibility for the rest of Africa (except Algeria and the Union of South Africa)
                in 1937.</p>
