            <p>The Department of State established the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs by
                administrative order on Sep 18, 1969, to enhance the Departmentâ€™s role in the
                formulation of international security policy, to supervise security assistance and
                foreign military sales programs, and to direct the issuance of arms export licenses.
                The bureau replaced a special component for politico-military affairs that had
                served under the Deputy Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs since 1960.
                The Director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, who was designated by the
                Secretary of State, had rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary of State. </p>
