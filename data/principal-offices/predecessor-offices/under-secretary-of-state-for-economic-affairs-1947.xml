            <p>An Act of Congress first authorized an Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs
                on Aug 1, 1946, for a 2-year period as the third-ranking officer in the Department
                (P.L. 79-590; 60 Stat. 789). The position was not renewed, however, and between 1947
                and 1958 the ranking officer in the Department handling foreign economic matters was
                either a Deputy Under Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
