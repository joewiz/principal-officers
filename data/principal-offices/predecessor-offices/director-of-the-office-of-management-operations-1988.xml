            <p>The Department of State organized the Office of Management Operations in May 1975
                from the former Management Systems Staff, which had developed and examined new
                management systems and techniques. The Directors of the Office of Management
                Operations held rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary of State and were
                designated by the Secretary of State.</p>
