            <p>The Department of State by administrative action established the position of Deputy
                Under Secretary of State, after Congress authorized ten Assistant Secretary of State
                positions (two of which could be at the Deputy Under Secretary level) in the
                Department of State Reorganization Act of 1949 (May 26, 1949; P.L. 81-73; 63 Stat.
                111). The position was created as a result of a recommendation made by the
                Commission on the Organization of the Executive Branch of Government (Hoover
                Commission). The Deputy Under Secretary assisted the Secretary and Under Secretary
                in policy development and oversight of non-administrative activities of the
                Department. The Department replaced this position with a newly-created Deputy Under
                Secretary of State for Political Affairs in Aug 1955.</p>
