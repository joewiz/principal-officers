            <p>On Jun 30, 1958, Congress re-established the position of Under Secretary for Economic
                Affairs in the Mutual Security Act (P.L. 85-477; 72 Stat. 274). The following year,
                the Department of State Organization Act of Jul 30, 1959, authorized the President
                to appoint either an Under Secretary for Political Affairs or an Under Secretary for
                Economic Affairs (P.L. 86-117; 73 Stat. 265). Between 1959 and 1972, during periods
                when there was no Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, the ranking officer
                for foreign economic affairs was again either a Deputy Under Secretary or an
                Assistant Secretary of State. On Jul 13, 1972, Congress established separate and
                permanent positions at the Under Secretary of State level for Economic Affairs and
                for Political Affairs, in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act (P.L. 92-352; 86
                Stat. 490).</p>
