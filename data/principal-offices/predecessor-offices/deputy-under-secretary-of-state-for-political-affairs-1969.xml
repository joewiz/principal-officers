            <p>The Department of State by administrative action established the position of Deputy
                Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, after Congress authorized three
                Deputy Under Secretary positions in the State Department Reorganization Act of Aug
                5, 1955 (P.L. 84-250; 69 Stat. 536). Prior to the creation of the position of Under
                Secretary of State for Political Affairs in Aug 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for
                Political Affairs assisted the Secretary and Under Secretary in the formulation and
                conduct of U.S. foreign policy. After Aug 1959, the Deputy Under Secretary for
                Political Affairs served as a focal point for interdepartmental relations,
                especially those dealing with politico-military issues. During 1969, the Department
                discontinued the position and created a new Bureau for Politico-Military
                Affairs.</p>
