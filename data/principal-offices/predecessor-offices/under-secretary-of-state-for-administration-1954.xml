            <p>In an Act of Feb 7, 1953, Congress created for a 2-year period the position of Under
                Secretary of State for Administration as the third ranking officer in the Department
                (P.L. 83-2; 67 Stat. 4). The position was not renewed, however; and between 1955 and
                1978, the ranking officer in the Department handling administration and management
                questions was either a Deputy Under Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of State.</p>
